# ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE - READ BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

## 🚨 This is a DEMO Application

This Storm Surge / TrailForge application is designed for **demonstration and learning purposes only**. It contains several security considerations that MUST be addressed before any production deployment.

## 🔴 Critical Security Limitations

### 1. **No Authentication** 
- All API endpoints are publicly accessible
- No API key validation implemented
- No user authentication system

### 2. **No Rate Limiting**
- Vulnerable to DoS attacks
- No request throttling
- Unlimited API calls allowed

### 3. **Webhook Security Disabled** (in debug versions)
- Signature verification bypassed for testing
- Must be enabled for production

### 4. **Basic CORS Configuration**
- Some configs use wildcard (*) origins
- Must be restricted for production

### 5. **No Authorization**
- No role-based access control (RBAC)
- All authenticated users have full access

## ✅ Security Features Implemented

### 1. **SQL Injection Protection**
- All queries use parameterized statements
- Input validation with Pydantic
- Field whitelisting for dynamic queries

### 2. **XSS Protection** (Partially)
- Fixed innerHTML vulnerabilities
- Using textContent for user data
- JSON data properly escaped

### 3. **Secrets Management**
- All credentials removed from code
- Placeholder values provided
- Template files for configuration

### 4. **Container Security** (Partial)
- Some containers run as non-root
- Resource limits configured
- Health checks implemented

## 🛡️ Before Production Deployment

### Minimum Requirements:

1. **Enable Authentication**
   ```python
   # Add to all API endpoints
   @require_auth
   def api_endpoint():
       pass
   ```

2. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   from flask_limiter import Limiter
   limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)
   ```

3. **Enable Webhook Signatures**
   - Remove debug bypasses
   - Implement proper HMAC verification

4. **Add Security Headers**
   ```python
   @app.after_request
   def security_headers(response):
       response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
       response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
       return response
   ```

5. **Restrict CORS**
   ```python
   CORS(app, origins=['https://yourdomain.com'])
   ```

## 🚧 Known Vulnerabilities

| **Issue** | **Severity** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** |
|-----------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| No Authentication | CRITICAL | Anyone can access APIs | Implement OAuth2/JWT |
| No Rate Limiting | HIGH | DoS attacks possible | Add rate limiting |
| Debug Mode Active | HIGH | Verbose errors exposed | Disable debug mode |
| Webhook Bypass | HIGH | Fake webhooks possible | Enable signatures |
| Open CORS | MEDIUM | Cross-origin attacks | Restrict origins |

## 📋 Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Implement authentication (OAuth2, JWT, or API keys)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to all endpoints
- [ ] Enable webhook signature verification
- [ ] Use HTTPS exclusively (force redirect)
- [ ] Implement proper CORS policy
- [ ] Add all security headers
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Run security scanning tools
- [ ] Implement network policies
- [ ] Use secrets management service
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Penetration testing

## 🔐 Deployment Recommendations

### For Demos:
- Deploy in isolated environment
- Use temporary credentials
- Limit network access
- Monitor for abuse
- Destroy after demo

### For Production:
- Complete ALL security checklist items
- Use managed services (Cloud Run, App Engine)
- Enable WAF/Cloud Armor
- Implement monitoring/alerting
- Regular security audits
- Incident response plan

## ⚡ Quick Start (Demo Only)

```bash
# 1. Copy templates
cp middleware/secret-template.yaml middleware/secret.yaml

# 2. Add your credentials
# Edit secret.yaml with your values

# 3. Deploy with warnings
kubectl apply -f . --namespace=demo

# 4. Add warning banner to UI
echo "⚠️ DEMO MODE - NOT FOR PRODUCTION" > warning.txt
```
