# Security Incident Response Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the security incident response procedures for Storm Surge deployments. It provides step-by-step guidance for detecting, containing, investigating, and recovering from security incidents.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical (P0)** | Active attack, data breach, system compromise | 15 minutes | Root access gained, data exfiltration, ransomware |
| **High (P1)** | Significant security risk, potential compromise | 1 hour | Privilege escalation, unauthorized access attempts |
| **Medium (P2)** | Security policy violation, suspicious activity | 4 hours | Failed authentication spikes, policy violations |
| **Low (P3)** | Minor security issues, informational | 24 hours | Configuration drift, outdated certificates |

### Incident Types

- **Unauthorized Access**: Successful or attempted unauthorized system access
- **Malware/Ransomware**: Malicious software detected or suspected
- **Data Breach**: Confirmed or suspected data exfiltration
- **Denial of Service**: Service availability impact due to malicious activity
- **Insider Threat**: Malicious or negligent insider activity
- **Supply Chain**: Compromise of third-party components or dependencies
- **Configuration Drift**: Security configurations changed without authorization

## Detection and Alerting

### Automated Detection

**Security Monitoring Alerts:**
```bash
# High-priority security alerts
kubectl get events --field-selector reason=NetworkPolicyViolation
kubectl get events --field-selector reason=FailedMount
kubectl get events --field-selector reason=SecurityContextConstraintViolation

# Resource anomalies
kubectl top pods --sort-by=cpu
kubectl top pods --sort-by=memory

# Failed authentication attempts
kubectl logs -l app=auth-service | grep "authentication failed"
```

**Prometheus Alert Rules:**
```yaml
groups:
- name: security.rules
  rules:
  - alert: HighFailedAuthentications
    expr: rate(authentication_failures_total[5m]) > 10
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High rate of authentication failures"
      
  - alert: SuspiciousNetworkActivity
    expr: rate(network_policy_violations_total[5m]) > 5
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: high
    annotations:
      summary: "Unusual network policy violations detected"
```

### Manual Detection Indicators

**Security Indicators to Monitor:**
- Unusual resource consumption patterns
- New or modified deployments without change management
- Network connections to unknown external hosts
- Failed authentication spikes
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unusual file system modifications
- Unexpected service account usage

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### 1. Incident Declaration
```bash
# Declare incident immediately when:
- Critical severity indicators detected
- Automated security alerts trigger
- Manual suspicious activity identified
- External notification of compromise received

# Actions:
1. Page incident response team
2. Create incident channel: #security-incident-YYYY-MM-DD-NN
3. Begin incident log documentation
4. Assess initial impact and scope
```

#### 2. Immediate Containment
```bash
# Network Isolation
./scripts/lockitdown.sh --force

# Container Isolation (if specific container compromised)
kubectl scale deployment/suspicious-app --replicas=0 -n oceansurge

# Emergency Network Policies
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: incident-isolation
  namespace: oceansurge
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress: []
  egress:
  - to: []
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 53
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
EOF
```

#### 3. Preserve Evidence
```bash
# Capture system state
kubectl get all,configmap,secret,networkpolicy --all-namespaces -o yaml > incident-state-$(date +%s).yaml

# Container logs
kubectl logs --all-containers=true --tail=-1 -n oceansurge > incident-logs-$(date +%s).log

# Network state
kubectl get networkpolicies --all-namespaces -o yaml > network-policies-$(date +%s).yaml

# Running processes (if applicable)
kubectl exec -it suspicious-pod -- ps aux > process-list-$(date +%s).txt
```

### Phase 2: Investigation (15 minutes - 2 hours)

#### 1. Threat Assessment
```bash
# Analyze attack vectors
./scripts/security-audit.sh --comprehensive > security-assessment-$(date +%s).txt

# Check for indicators of compromise
grep -r "suspicious_pattern" /var/log/containers/
kubectl logs -l app=auth-service --since=1h | grep -E "(failed|error|unauthorized)"

# Vulnerability assessment
trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL . > vuln-scan-$(date +%s).json
```

#### 2. Scope Determination
```bash
# Affected systems inventory
kubectl get pods -l "app in (frontend,shopping-cart,product-catalog)" --show-labels

# Data access assessment
kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep -E "(namespace|name):"

# User impact analysis
kubectl get events --sort-by='.firstTimestamp' | tail -50
```

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis
**Investigation Checklist:**
- [ ] Timeline of events leading to incident
- [ ] Entry point identification
- [ ] Attack vector analysis
- [ ] Privilege escalation methods
- [ ] Lateral movement patterns
- [ ] Data or system access scope
- [ ] Persistence mechanisms
- [ ] External communication analysis

### Phase 3: Eradication (2-8 hours)

#### 1. Threat Removal
```bash
# Remove malicious containers
kubectl delete pod suspicious-pod -n oceansurge --force --grace-period=0

# Update compromised images
kubectl set image deployment/app-deployment container=new-secure-image:tag -n oceansurge

# Rotate compromised credentials
kubectl delete secret compromised-secret -n oceansurge
kubectl create secret generic new-secure-secret --from-literal=key=new-value -n oceansurge
```

#### 2. Vulnerability Patching
```bash
# Apply security patches
kubectl apply -k manifests/security/emergency-patches/

# Update container images
kubectl set image deployment/all-deployments app=secure-image:patched-version -n oceansurge

# Harden configurations
./scripts/security-audit.sh --fix-issues
```

#### 3. Security Hardening
```bash
# Apply additional security controls
kubectl apply -f manifests/security/incident-response-hardening.yaml

# Update security policies
kubectl apply -f manifests/security/enhanced-network-policies.yaml

# Enable additional monitoring
kubectl apply -k manifests/monitoring/security-monitoring/
```

### Phase 4: Recovery (4-24 hours)

#### 1. System Restoration
```bash
# Gradual service restoration
kubectl scale deployment/frontend --replicas=2 -n oceansurge
kubectl scale deployment/shopping-cart --replicas=1 -n oceansurge
kubectl scale deployment/product-catalog --replicas=2 -n oceansurge

# Health validation
kubectl get pods -n oceansurge
./scripts/demo-validation.sh

# Load testing
./scripts/demo-load-test.sh --duration=300
```

#### 2. Security Validation
```bash
# Comprehensive security scan
./scripts/security-audit.sh --comprehensive

# Penetration testing (if required)
./scripts/security-pentest.sh --post-incident

# Configuration validation
kubectl apply --dry-run=client -k manifests/base/
```

#### 3. Monitoring Enhancement
```bash
# Deploy enhanced monitoring
kubectl apply -k manifests/monitoring/post-incident/

# Configure additional alerts
kubectl apply -f manifests/monitoring/incident-response-alerts.yaml

# Enable audit logging
kubectl apply -f manifests/security/audit-logging.yaml
```
