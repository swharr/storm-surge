## v0.1.1-Alpha-POC – July 2025


## 📦 Storm Surge v0.1.1-Alpha-POC

_Released: July 2025_  
This release introduces the first working implementation of the FinOps Controller, early-stage testing harnesses, and updated documentation for extensibility and scaling experiments.

### 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ **Initial FinOps Controller prototype**  
  - `finops/finops_controller.py` includes a scheduled job framework using `schedule`, with stubbed methods for after-hours autoscaling disablement.
  - Placeholder logging and control structure for integrating LaunchDarkly feature flags and Spot Ocean APIs.
  - Prepares ground for real-time cost-aware infrastructure decisions.

- 🧪 **New test harnesses added**
  - `finops/tests/test_basic.py`: Sanity test coverage
  - `finops/tests/test_finops_controller.py`: Unit test skeletons for controller logic
  - `finops/tests/test_integration.py`: Placeholder for full integration tests (coming in v0.1.2)

- 📜 **Documentation Enhancements**
  - `docs/FINOPS.md`: Now includes environment setup, usage guide, and savings expectations across environments.
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Updated to reflect the FinOps Controller as an official component of the system.
  - `docs/REPOSITORY.md`: Clarified dual naming convention (OceanSurge repo, Storm Surge product), and added deploy + access examples.

- 🛠️ **New deployment and chaos tooling**
  - Added `scripts/deploy-finops.sh` to automate FinOps Controller deployment.
  - Introduced `chaos-testing/lightning-strike.sh` for simulating random disruptions (experimental).

- 🧹 **Structural & Naming Fixes**
  - Repo renaming script `fix-repo-naming.sh` included to enforce standard naming conventions across the project.
  - Git utility script `git-storm-surge-create.sh` added for rapid project creation and tagging.
