## [Unreleased]

### 🧹 Code Quality & Shell Script Improvements - July 18, 2025
- **Trailing Whitespace Cleanup**
  - Removed trailing whitespace from all project files
  - Fixed `manifests/base/kustomization.yaml`, `tests/hooks/validate-deploy-scripts.sh`, and `git-storm-surge-create.sh`
  - Ensured all 70+ files end with a single newline character for consistent formatting

- **File Permissions Standardization**
  - Made `chaos-testing/lightning-strike.sh` executable with proper permissions
  - Fixed shebang executable status for chaos testing script

- **Offline Manifest Validation**
  - Enhanced `tests/hooks/validate-manifests.sh` to support offline validation
  - Updated `test-local.sh` to use standalone kustomize tool when available
  - Added connectivity detection before attempting server-side validation
  - Implemented graceful fallbacks: full validation → offline validation → basic YAML validation
  - Fixed API server dependency issues for offline environments

- **Comprehensive ShellCheck Compliance**
  - Fixed 15 `read` commands missing `-r` flag across deployment scripts
  - Fixed trap quoting issue in `scripts/prod_deploy_preview.sh` (double quotes → single quotes)
  - Added proper variable quoting for safety:
    - Fixed boolean variable tests in `scripts/cleanup/cluster-sweep.sh`
    - Quoted URL variables in curl commands (3 files)
    - Fixed function parameter quoting in deployment scripts
    - Separated local declaration from assignment to avoid masking return values
  - Enhanced script robustness against special characters and word splitting
  - All critical ShellCheck warnings resolved across 19 shell scripts

### 🧪 Test Coverage & Quality Improvements
- **Comprehensive Test Suite Expansion**
  - Added 24 comprehensive middleware tests covering Flask endpoints, webhook handling, and Spot API integration
  - Implemented 19 security tests for Kubernetes configurations, secrets management, and container security
  - Created 26 script validation tests for deployment scripts, provider scripts, and security compliance
  - Fixed missing dependencies in FinOps controller tests (43 tests now passing)
  - Added virtual environment setup for proper test isolation

### 🔧 FinOps Controller Fixes

  - Added container image security checks (no :latest tags, trusted registries)
  - Created script security validation (permissions, credentials, shebangs)
  - Added Dockerfile security practice validation
  - Implemented compliance checks for Pod Security Standards and CIS benchmarks

### 🔧 Script Improvements
- **Cleanup Script Array Matching Fix**
  - Fixed problematic regex-based array matching in `scripts/cleanup/cluster-sweep.sh`
  - Replaced `if [[ ! " ${PROTECTED_NAMESPACES[@]} " =~ " $ns " ]]` with proper loop-based matching
  - Improved reliability and eliminated potential edge cases with special characters
  - Enhanced code clarity and maintainability

- **Script Standards Compliance**
  - Added missing shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) to `scripts/lockitdown.sh`
  - Added `set -e` error handling to `scripts/load-test.sh` and `scripts/lockitdown.sh`
  - Verified all 10 scripts in `/scripts` directory have proper configuration:
    - ✅ All scripts have shebangs
    - ✅ All scripts have error handling (`set -e`)
    - ✅ All scripts are executable
    - ✅ All scripts have valid syntax

- **Python File Permissions Audit**
  - Fixed chmod attributes for middleware and test scripts with shebangs
  - Made executable all Python files with `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks:
    - `manifests/middleware/main.py` (middleware entry point)
    - `finops/finops_controller.py` (FinOps controller entry point)
    - `finops/tests/test_basic.py`, `test_finops_controller.py`, `test_integration.py`
    - `tests/test_middleware.py`, `test_security.py`, `test_scripts.py`
  - Verified proper permissions: executable files have `rwxr-xr-x`, non-executable have `rw-r--r--`
  - All Python files with shebangs now have correct permissions based on functionality

- **Exit Code Handling Improvements**
  - Eliminated problematic `$?` usage in provider scripts
  - Fixed `retry_command` exit code checking in `scripts/providers/aks.sh`, `gke.sh`, and `eks.sh`
  - Changed from `retry_command ...; if [ $? -eq 0 ]` to `if retry_command ...; then` pattern
  - Improved `$?` usage in `tests/hooks/validate-security.sh` with immediate variable capture
  - All remaining `$?` usages now follow bash best practices for reliable error handling

- **Variable Expansion Security Improvements**
  - Fixed unquoted variables in test expressions in provider scripts
  - Updated `if [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]` to `if [ "$attempt" -lt "$max_attempts" ]` in all providers
  - Protected user input variables in error messages with proper quoting
  - Fixed potential command injection in echo statements: `echo "Unknown argument: \"$arg\"`
  - Enhanced bash script security by eliminating dangerous variable expansion patterns

### 📊 Test Results Summary
